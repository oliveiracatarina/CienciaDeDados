### **EDA \- WORKFLOW Detailed**

EDA is an iterative process of analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often using visual methods. It helps to discover patterns, detect anomalies, test hypotheses, and check assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations.

**1\. Build a DataFrame from the data (ideally, put all data in this object).**

* **Objective:** To consolidate all your data into a unified, easy-to-manipulate structure. The `DataFrame` (typically from pandas in Python, or its counterpart in other languages/tools) is the standard tool for this.  
* **Why:**  
  * **Consistency:** Ensures that all your subsequent analyses are based on the same data and that any transformations applied affect the entire dataset.  
  * **Ease of Manipulation:** DataFrames offer powerful methods for selecting, filtering, transforming, and aggregating data.  
  * **Visualization:** Most visualization libraries integrate seamlessly with DataFrames.  
* **Common Actions:**  
  * Loading data from various sources: CSV, Excel, databases (SQL), JSON, APIs, etc.  
  * Combining multiple files or tables into a single DataFrame (using `pd.concat`, `pd.merge`).  
  * Ensuring correct character encoding when loading (e.g., UTF-8).

**2\. Clean the DataFrame. It should have the following properties:**

This is a crucial phase to ensure the quality and usability of your data.

* **Each row describes a single object:**

  * **Common Problem:** "Wide" data where multiple observations of the same object are in the same row, or overly "long" data where a single observation is split across multiple rows unnecessarily.  
  * **Solution:** Reformat the DataFrame so that each row represents a distinct unit of analysis (e.g., one customer, one transaction, one sensor reading). This often involves `melt` to transform from wide to long, or `pivot` for the opposite.  
* **Each column describes a property of that object:**

  * **Common Problem:** Columns containing more than one property (e.g., "FirstName\_LastName" in a single column), or columns that are incorrectly indexed.  
  * **Solution:** Ensure that each column represents a single characteristic or attribute. This might mean splitting columns, renaming columns for clarity, or dropping irrelevant columns.  
* **Columns are numeric whenever appropriate:**

  * **Common Problem:** Numbers stored as text (strings), categories that should be numeric (e.g., "Yes"/"No" as strings instead of 1/0).  
  * **Solution:**  
    * **Type Conversion:** Use `astype()` or `pd.to_numeric()` to convert columns to numeric types (int, float).  
    * **Handling Non-Numeric Values:** Deal with conversion errors (e.g., using `errors='coerce'` to turn them into NaN).  
    * **Categorical Data:** For categorical columns that have an inherent order (e.g., 'Small', 'Medium', 'Large'), consider mapping them to ordinal numbers.  
* **Columns contain atomic properties that cannot be further decomposed:**

  * **Common Problem:** Columns that contain composite information (e.g., "Full Address" containing street, number, city, state, zip code).  
  * **Solution:** Decompose these columns into their component parts. For example, splitting "Full Address" into "Street", "Number", "City", "State", "Zip Code". This facilitates granular analysis and the use of this information in models.

**Additional Cleaning Actions (Implicit in this phase):**

* **Handling Missing Values:**  
  * Identify (`isnull().sum()`).  
  * Decide on a strategy: Remove rows/columns (`dropna`), fill with values (mean, median, mode, constant \- `fillna`), or use more advanced techniques.  
* **Handling Duplicates:**  
  * Identify (`duplicated().sum()`).  
  * Remove (`drop_duplicates()`).  
* **Outliers:**  
  * Identify visually (boxplots, scatter plots) or statistically (Z-score, IQR).  
  * Decide on a strategy: Remove, transform, or keep and address during modeling.

**3\. Explore global properties. Use histograms, scatter plots, and aggregation functions to summarize the data.**

* **Objective:** To gain a comprehensive overview of your dataset's characteristics as a whole. Understand the distribution of individual variables and the relationships between them.

* **Why:** This step helps to form a mental picture of your dataset, identify general trends, spot anomalies that might have been missed during cleaning, and formulate initial hypotheses. It's the first "deep look" at your data.

* **Tools and Common Actions:**

  * **Descriptive Statistics:**  
    * Use `df.describe()` for numeric columns to get count, mean, std, min, max, and quartiles.  
    * Use `df.info()` to check data types and non-null counts.  
    * Use `df.value_counts()` for categorical columns to see the frequency of each category.  
  * **Histograms:**  
    * **Purpose:** Visualize the distribution of a *single numeric column*. They show the frequency or density of data points within different bins or intervals.  
    * **Insights:** Identify skewness (left/right), modality (unimodal, bimodal), presence of outliers, and the spread of data.  
    * **Example:** A histogram of 'Customer Age' might show that most customers are between 25-40 years old.  
  * **Scatter Plots:**  
    * **Purpose:** Visualize the relationship between *two numeric columns*. Each point on the plot represents an observation, with its position determined by the values of the two variables.  
    * **Insights:** Detect correlations (positive, negative, no correlation), clusters, and potential outliers.  
    * **Example:** A scatter plot of 'Advertising Spend' vs. 'Sales' might show a positive linear relationship.  
  * **Aggregation Functions:**  
    * **Purpose:** Summarize data using functions like `mean()`, `median()`, `sum()`, `min()`, `max()`, `count()`, `std()` applied to entire columns.  
    * **Insights:** Get high-level summaries of key metrics.  
    * **Example:** Calculate the `mean()` 'Order Value' across all transactions, or the `sum()` of 'Revenue'.  
  * **Box Plots (for numeric distributions across categories):**  
    * **Purpose:** Visualize the distribution of a numeric variable for different categories. Shows median, quartiles, and potential outliers.  
    * **Insights:** Compare central tendency and spread across groups.  
    * **Example:** A box plot of 'Salaries' by 'Department' could show if some departments have higher median salaries or more variability.  
  * **Correlation Matrix/Heatmap:**  
    * **Purpose:** Quantify and visualize the linear relationship between *all pairs of numeric columns*.  
    * **Insights:** Identify strong positive or negative correlations, which can indicate potential multicollinearity or useful feature interactions.

**4\. Explore group properties. Use groupby and small multiples to compare subsets of the data.**

* **Objective:** Dive deeper into specific segments or subsets of your data to understand how properties vary across different groups. This moves beyond a global view to a more granular, comparative analysis.

* **Why:** Many insights are hidden within subgroups. Comparing groups helps to identify patterns, differences, or anomalies that might be obscured when looking at the data globally. This is crucial for segmentation, targeted strategies, and understanding conditional relationships.

* **Tools and Common Actions:**

  * **`groupby()` (in pandas):**  
    * **Purpose:** Split the DataFrame into groups based on one or more categorical columns, apply an aggregation function (like mean, sum, count, std, etc.) to each group, and combine the results.  
    * **Insights:** Calculate group-specific metrics.  
    * **Example:** `df.groupby('Product_Category')['Sales'].sum()` to see total sales per product category. Or `df.groupby(['Gender', 'Age_Group'])['Purchase_Amount'].mean()` to see average purchase amount by gender and age group.  
  * **Small Multiples (Trellis Plots / Faceting):**  
    * **Purpose:** Create multiple small plots, each representing a different subset of the data (often based on a categorical variable), using the same axes and scales. This allows for easy visual comparison across groups.  
    * **Insights:** Compare distributions, trends, or relationships across different groups side-by-side without overlapping information. Helps to spot if a trend observed globally holds true for all subgroups, or if it's driven by a specific group.  
    * **Example:**  
      * **Histograms as Small Multiples:** Create a separate histogram of 'Customer Age' for each 'Region' to see if age distribution varies by region.  
      * **Scatter Plots as Small Multiples:** Plot 'Hours Studied' vs. 'Exam Score' for each 'Study Method' to see if the relationship changes based on the study method.  
      * **Line Plots as Small Multiples:** Plot 'Monthly Sales' over time for each 'Store Location' to compare sales trends across different stores.  
    * **Libraries:** Libraries like `seaborn` (e.g., `FacetGrid`, `relplot`, `displot`) and `matplotlib` (using subplots) are excellent for creating small multiples.

By systematically going through these steps, you gain a deep understanding of your data, uncover valuable insights, identify potential issues, and formulate hypotheses that will guide your subsequent modeling or decision-making processes. EDA is not a one-time task; it's often an iterative process where new questions arise as you explore.
